===================================================================
Note about organization of the symbols files.  These are
segregated by how Sublime Text uses them.

LIST -- These are symbols that ST identifies for LOCAL usage and
        will show up in the "Goto Symbol" list in the editor.
        For VHDL purposes, I am primarily using this for navigation
        and the items showing up should be the entity, architecture,
        instantiations, and processes (if labeled).

INDEX - These are symbols that ST identifies GLOBALLY and will
        show up in "Goto Definition" and "Goto Anything" lists.
        They will also show up in hover text over a token name.
        For VHDL purposes, I am using this for anything that
        would be used for "Goto Definition".  There might be
        overlap in a global project but hoping that the default
        would be local scope.

All these constructs exist in separate files in case transformation
rules need to be applied to them.
