# Contributing

First of all, thank you for choosing to participate.  More eyes and more hands
will make for a better product.

Please review this before contributing to the project.  It'll help keep things
tidy.

1. If bugs are found, please use the Issues page and create an issue there.
   It would be very helpful to include a VHDL code example that demonstrates
   the bug behavior, if at all possible.
1. If features are desired, again, please use the Issues page and we can discuss
   it. Depending on what's requested, there's a very good chance it can be
   introduced.
1. All Pull-Requests should target develop, not master.  Master is reserved for
   releases.
1. For contributing code, please fork off the develop branch.  I do tend to
   keep the develop branch updated with my own changes.  If master is forked,
   you may not have all the up-to-date alterations. Even if it's a minor
   addition, forking off of master and then doing a Pull Request to develop
   can cause some weirdness in the Pull Request since master usually only gets
   PRs from develop.

I make certain that contributions are acknowledged in the documentation.

I think that's about it.  Thanks again for considering contributing bugs,
ideas, or code to this Sublime Text package.  I really appreciate it.
