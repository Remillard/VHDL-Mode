Version 1.8.5

* Probably should have done this a long time ago, however I've added a number
  of commands to the right-click context menu under the "VHDL Mode" subheading.
  Unfortunately the subheading will remain visible no matter what, however
  the commands will not show if you aren't editing a VHDL source file.

As always, if bugs are discovered, or features desired, please visit
https://github.com/Remillard/VHDL-Mode/issues and open an issue and we can
discuss it.  If contributing code, please fork from and submit pull requests to
the `develop` branch.
