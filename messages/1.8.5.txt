Version 1.8.5

* Probably should have done this a long time ago, however I've added a number
  of commands to the right-click context menu under the "VHDL Mode" subheading.
  Unfortunately the subheading will remain visible no matter what, however
  the commands will not show if you aren't editing a VHDL source file.
* The "paste" commands will show the name of the object last copied in the
  menu.  If there has been no copy performed, the menu items will not show.

As always, if bugs are discovered, or features desired, please visit
https://github.com/Remillard/VHDL-Mode/issues and open an issue and we can
discuss it.  If contributing code, please fork from and submit pull requests to
the `develop` branch.
