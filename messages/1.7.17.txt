Version 1.7.16

* Fixed issue where beautification would trigger on text that exists in
  strings.  Issue #106.
* Altered a behavior to default to tabs rather than spaces for port
  copying so that the user's Sublime Text preferences will take effect
  upon saving. (Stefan Lippuner)
* Altered the order of the keybinds to make certain the default keybinds
  show up in the Command Palette hint (right side) instead of the Emacs ones.
  It's unlikely that Emacsen folk will be using the command palette too much
  and are likely to know the vhdl-mode keybinds by touch.
* Fixed generic map snippet having a trailing semicolon.
