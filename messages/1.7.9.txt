* Altered stutter typing keybinds for the arrow symbols so that they do not
  trigger while in the middle of a comment (so that typing ellipsis in
  documentation wouldn't create a => symbol.)
* Corrected syntax definition error where the else clause in an if-generate
  did not require the word `generate`.
* Corrected syntax definition error where the code interior in an if-generate
  would not lex correctly.  I had used the `match` directive when I wanted
  `include` for concurrent.
* Generated a snippet for if-generate because this one seemed tedious.  The
  snippet trigger is `ifgen` and doesn't seem to conflict with the more
  usual `if` snippet.
