Version 1.7.15

* Added a user setting for desired line length.  This only affects the following
  functions: insert comment line, insert comment box, and insert header template.
  The new setting is `vhdl-line-length` and defaults to 80 characters (so if
  you are happy with the current behavior you won't see any difference.)  If a
  client or project requires a different line length standard, this may be
  customized in the project settings to be specific to that project.
* If your cursor is beyond your `vhdl-line-length` margin and you attempt to
  insert a commment line, or insert a comment box, it should degrade somewhat
  gracefully and simply produce a minimal amount of commenting, and will also
  generate a warning in the console to let the user know that the output
  could not be generated perfectly.
* The project file helper snippet was altered to demonstrate the use of the
  dynamic line field for a few of those optional header blocks, and also
  demonstrates setting the line length setting there as well (again the
  package default is 80 characters so if no change is desired, all this
  may be ignored safely.)
