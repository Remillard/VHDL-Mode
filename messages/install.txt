VHDL Mode for Sublime Text 3
----------------------------
Thanks for trying this out.  This is an attempt to emulate the Emacs vhdl-mode
commands and capabilities.  This is also my first Sublime Text 3 plugin so it's
been an interesting ride so far.

If any odd or buggy behavior is found, I would greatly appreciate it if you'd
take a moment and drop me a line on the Github Issues page for the project.
If there's an additional capability that you'd like, please do the same.
If there's beautification or alignment or syntax issues, a sample of code that
demonstrates it would be greatly appreciated though I understand it's not
always possible to due to proprietary design information.
