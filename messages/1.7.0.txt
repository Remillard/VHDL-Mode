* Added the subprogram parameter flattening command.
* Abstracted the beautification rules into a YAML file for easier maintenance.
* Added ruamel.yaml as a dependency to support the above behavior.  Restarting Sublime Text may be required.
* Corrected bug regarding beautification of `constant` items inside of subprogram parameters.
* Altered the scope for a process label to `entity.name.label.vhdl` (was: `entity.name.process.vhdl`)
* Added in my test file into the project to keep track of it.
* Updated documentation.
