Version 1.8.7

* Fixed a long-time bug (Issue #104) finally.  This issue involved a subtle
  issue with how single quote character literals were captured in the syntax
  file.  I'd been using a "not a character" construct to distinguish a single
  quoted character literal from a singleton single quote used for attributes
  or typecasting.  However this would consume the "not a character" which
  caused some problems with scoping the character consumed especially if it
  was a parenthesis.  The actual solution was to use a look-forward and make
  sure this was a character literal before capturing a character literal.
  In any event, this bug has been around for awhile any my apologies to
  @lenigoor, @Sv3n and anyone else impacted by it.
