Version 1.8.9

* Tweaked beautification rules to permit putting an entire `if/then/end if`
  statement on the same line as `when <choice> =>`.
* Altered language syntax rules to attempt to scope the typecast `'` mark for
  known types.  This was done because an autogenerated bit of code came up
  with `std_logic'('0')` which really confused the syntax rules.
* Adjusted the order of some alignment to make long lists of when choices with
  in-line assignments all line up properly.

The IEEE VHDL standard 1076-2019 was approved on 2019-09-05.  Fair warning that
it may be some time until this package supports it properly.
