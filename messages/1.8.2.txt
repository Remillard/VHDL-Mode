Version 1.8.1

* Added a build system for Aldec Riviera PRO simulator in the project snippet.
  I am really digging Riviera Pro for simulation.  Let me know if there's any
  strangeness there.  There are a lot of escape slashes in the snippet to get
  correct.
* Improved beautification in a couple of areas, mainly around assignment
  operators.  Created a method by which a rule match may be ignored when
  inside declared contexts which resolves ambiguity around <= as less than or
  equal and <= as assignment.

Version 1.8.2

* Corrected a behavior where whitespace was added at the end of a line.
  Previously Sublime would always remove this with the right setting, however
  now with the new "mini-diff" aspect, it show change bars on every line until
  you save the file.  So since that's pretty blatant, I corrected it myself
  for beautification so it doesn't show up.
* Corrected Sublime Text messages.json file which meant there was no update
  message for version 1.8.1 (which is why this one includes the 1.8.1 update
  text.)
