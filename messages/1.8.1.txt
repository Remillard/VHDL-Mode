Version 1.8.1

* Added a build system for Aldec Riviera PRO simulator in the project snippet.
  I am really digging Riviera Pro for simulation.  Let me know if there's any
  strangeness there.  There are a lot of escape slashes in the snippet to get
  correct.
* Improved beautification in a couple of areas, mainly around assignment
  operators.  Created a method by which a rule match may be ignored when
  inside declared contexts which resolves ambiguity around <= as less than or
  equal and <= as assignment.
