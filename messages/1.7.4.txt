* Split out the keybinds into three files for each operating system.
* Altered Preferences >> Package Settings >> VHDL Mode >> Key Bindings menu
  command to pull up the keybindings and personal user keybindings side by
  side, similar to settings.
* Implemented Emacs vhdl-mode continuous commenting feature.  While writing a
  comment line, if the final character before hitting Enter is a space, the
  next line will also be a comment, with the commenting characters automatically
  inserted.
