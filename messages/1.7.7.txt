* The solution to lexing signal assignments with subprograms in the slice
  created a bug where other sequential structures that contained expressions
  would match as a signal assignment due to the fact that signal assignment and
  less than or equal to are the same symbol.  Lowered the priority of signal
  assignment in the syntax definition to solve this problem.
