Version 1.7.11

* Slight adjustment to the scope name for subprogram calls.  Subprograms
  are now correctly scoped as `meta.function-call` instead of what I had
  originally.
* Small change to regex for the standard env library so that it'll catch the
  full library path name because in this case it's more frequently used
  (e.g. std.env.stop(0)).
* Fixed a bug in the beautification rules where signals and variables starting
  with `end` (e.g. `end_flag`) could cause the ending of various structures
  like ifs and cases.
