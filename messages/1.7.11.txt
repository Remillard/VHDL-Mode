* Slight adjustment to the scope name for subprogram calls.  Subprograms
  are now correctly scoped as `meta.function-call` instead of what I had
  originally.
* Small change to regex for the standard env library so that it'll catch the
  full library path name because it's frequently used here
  (e.g. std.env.stop(0)).
