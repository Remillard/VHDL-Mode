Version 1.8.12

My apologies that these have been a long time coming.  Work life demands have
been pretty constant for quite awhile now.  The package is still supported and
active.

* For VHDL-2008 support, added the keyword `case?` to syntax and
  beautification. (Issue #162)
* Fixed the syntax for a return inside of a function body. (Issue #161)
* Fixed the scoping on variable assignment in a particular case where the
  left hand side contained a slice with internal expressions (it worked for
  signal assignments.) (Issue #163)
* Fixed scoping when typecasting is used on the left hand side of a mapping
  in a port instantiation. (Issue #158)

As always, if bugs are discovered, or features desired, please visit

discuss it.  If contributing code, please fork from and submit pull requests to
the `develop` branch.
