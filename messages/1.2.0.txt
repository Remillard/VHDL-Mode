* Extended updates to the package settings.  I believe these should be backwards compatible, but users will want to review their VHDL Mode Settings.
* Implemented a project file snippet that aids implementing build systems and local project settings.
* Beautification should pay attention to `translate_tabs_to_spaces` and `tab_size` settings.
* Customizeable on-save last modified time string (see settings.)
* Documentation updated to reflect enhancements to the settings files.
