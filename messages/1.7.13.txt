Version 1.7.13

* Alteration to the scope names for procedure, function, and process.  This was
  done to improve the syntax file's interaction with color schemes.  You may
  notice some small tweaks to names (primarily process labels) depending on your
  color scheme.  (Contributor: Sven Goossens)
* Corrections to case insensitivity and regular expression word boundaries for
  some keywords and support functions (math functions like `abs`).
  (Contributor: Sven Goossens)
* Corrections to a few match/capture pairs in syntax file that might have
  prevented proper scoping.  (Contributor: Sven Goossens).
* Fixed a small issue with operators in constant assignment expressions not
  being included for scoping.
