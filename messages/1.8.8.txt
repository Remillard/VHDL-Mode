Version 1.8.8

* Gently adjusted some scope names primarily surrounding words that often
  define the beginning and ending of code blocks.  Some color schemes might
  now show these better (and many won't if they don't utilize that scope.)
  In other places some constructs were better specified (such as `loop`
  becoming `keyword.control.flow.loop` instead of a more generic
  `keyword.other`).
* Added support for entity generic type.  It should scope, beautify, and
  properly copy with instance copying and testbench creation.  Thanks to
  @dkalex on the Sublime Forum for providing a really nice bug report with
  sample code and screenshots and everything.
