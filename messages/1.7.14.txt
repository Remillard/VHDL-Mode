Version 1.7.14

* Added aligning inline comments to the beautify routine.  Testing so far seems
  to work, but let me know if anything weird happens.
* Added the tmPreferences file that lets Sublime Text's base comment and
  uncommenting routine work correctly.  Since I'd written my own variation on
  this, it was an oversight to make ST's routine work also.
