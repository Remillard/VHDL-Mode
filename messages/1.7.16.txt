Version 1.7.16

* Removed the tab trigger command for the header snippet as it was causing some
  confusion.  The header should be inserted using the Insert Header command and
  not directly using the snippet.
* Added whitespace check for conditional generate so it doesn't flag instance
  names that start with `if`.
