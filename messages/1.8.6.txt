Version 1.8.6

* Per request, added the `block` construct to both syntax and beautification.
  Apologies for not catching this sooner as I do try for complete coverage of
  the language.  One caveat, while the LRM defines the keyword `is` as optional,
  I cannot support that variation in syntax.  I need to separate valid
  constructs in the guard expression region and the declarative region and the
  keyword `is` is my separator between the two.
* Also tweaked the snippet for `block` to make it of better use by putting
  the entire guard expression portion into a tab (so that the user may
  simply hit delete if no guard expression is desired -- probably most of the
  time) and adding a space for declarative region.
