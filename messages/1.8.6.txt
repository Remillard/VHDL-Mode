Version 1.8.6

* Per request, added the `block` construct to both syntax and beautification.
  Apologies for not catching this sooner as I do try for complete coverage of
  the language.  One caveat, while the LRM defines the keyword `is` as optional,
  I cannot support that variation in syntax.  I need to separate valid
  constructs in the guard expression region and the declarative region and the
  keyword `is` is my separator between the two.  Issue #133.  Thanks to
  @rolpks for finding this.
* Also tweaked the snippet for `block` to make it of better use by putting
  the entire guard expression portion into a tab (so that the user may
  simply hit delete if no guard expression is desired -- probably most of the
  time) and adding a space for declarative region.
* Block commenting did not beautify well as my comment ignoring method is
  centered around line comments.  Added some basic block comment support to
  beautification but be aware it's pretty basic currently until I can come up
  with a different model for handling it (or rather for everything else to
  ignore this text.) Issue #134
* Fixed a problem I noticed with if-generate beautification.  It wouldn't
  de-indent correctly and now it does.
