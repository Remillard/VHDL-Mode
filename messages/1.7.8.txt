* Corrected small VHDL syntax error in the testbench snippet used to create a
  testbench.  The constant declaration had a typo where the : was an =.
* Created a version of the keybind that handles the auto_match_enabled
  double quotes pairing that permits a leading oOxX for VHDL syntax files
  only.
