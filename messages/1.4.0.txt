* ALERT: The files have been reorganized inside the package.  If the VHDL syntax disappears, simply reselect that language from either View >> Syntax or use the lower right corner selector box to reselect VHDL.  The syntax scoping (and coloring) should reappear.
* Major refactoring to split up large python files
* Added subprogram copying capability.  Please see README for documentation.
* Corrected error in testbench creation where the entity name was not appended with *_tb even though the filename was correctly created.
