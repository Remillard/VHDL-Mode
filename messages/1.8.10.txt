Version 1.8.10

* I think I've got case/when alignment structures more or less sorted out and
  no one had to die or anything this time around.  Assignments followed by
  positional arguments should align correctly in that order most of the time,
  and then `when choice =>` should align correctly followed by assignments on
  those lines.  Hopefully that settles the matter once and for all, but I'll
  take another crack at it if something goes pear shaped.

  Just a note, all you folks who are putting a ton of things on the same
  `when choice =>` line for compactness, there is a limit to this and I think
  I've reached it.  If you are getting beautification results you don't like
  because you've put entire paragraphs on the same line after a `when choice =>`
  just put it on the next few lines please.  Your code maintainer will thank
  you someday (or at least won't curse your name overmuch.)
