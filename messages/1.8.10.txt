Version 1.8.10

* I think I've got case/when alignment structures more or less sorted out and
  no one had to die or anything this time around.  Assignments followed by
  positional arguments should align correctly in that order most of the time,
  and then `when choice =>` should align correctly followed by assignments on
  those lines.  Hopefully that settles the matter once and for all, but I'll
  take another crack at it if something goes pear shaped.

  Just a note, all you folks who are putting a ton of things on the same
  `when choice =>` line for compactness, there is a limit to this and I think
  I've reached it.  If you are getting beautification results you don't like
  because you've put entire paragraphs on the same line after a `when choice =>`
  just put it on the next few lines please.  Your code maintainer will thank
  you someday (or at least won't curse your name overmuch.)

* Added basic support for aggregate assignment.  The location of this paren
  group is in a tricky spot (due to the way the syntax file is setup looking
  for lexical contexts) so it really is just basic support.  I don't think
  symbols or identifiers inside the paren group will scope as finely grained
  as in other places in the code, but at least it won't flag as an invalid
  closing paren anymore.  I might be able to get something more sophisticated
  in place with more experimentation since this might be the only VHDL construct
  that starts with opening parenthesis.

The IEEE VHDL standard 1076-2019 was approved on 2019-09-05.  Fair warning that
it may be some time until this package supports it properly.
