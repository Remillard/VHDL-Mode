Version 1.8.3

* Fixed another bug in the messages.json file which shows the changes that were
  altered in the version.  I don't know if it'll display anything for prior
  revisions so please feel free to visit
             https://github.com/Remillard/VHDL-Mode/releases
  for the change notes for the past few releases.  They mirror what I put into
  this file.
* Fixed a problem with the regex for the assignment operator when working with
  multiline statements. (Issue #125).
* Fixed a problem with the regex of when to ignore a `when` statement for case
  statements, but also properly accept `when` in assignments.  (Issue #126)
* Tweaked a few snippets for better usability.
* Fine tuned subprogram beautification particularly around the closing paren
  of the interface declaration (Issue #89).
* Fixed function syntax for operator overloading.  (Issue #128)
* Fixed range keyword syntax not being scoped in an interface declaration
  (Issue #127)
* Fixed scope error for `assert` for sequential statements.  (Issue #124)
* Fixed issue with subprogram copying.  My apologies to all who may have needed
  that feature as the bug had stuck around for a long time.  I believe it's
  fixed now though.  (Issue #90)
* Fixed a little problem that re-emerged with the recent release of Sublime
  where my post-beautification viewport shift fix was no longer working.  Had
  to add a little more delay in the shift to get past the screen repaint that
  happens when the buffer is replaced.
