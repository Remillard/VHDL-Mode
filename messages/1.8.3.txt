Version 1.8.3

* Fixed another bug in the messages.json file which shows the changes that were
  altered in the version.  I don't know if it'll display anything for prior
  revisions so please feel free to visit
             https://github.com/Remillard/VHDL-Mode/releases
  for the change notes for the past few releases.  They mirror what I put into
  this file.
* Fixed a problem with the regex for the assignment operator when working with
  multiline statements. (Issue #125).
* Fixed a problem with the regex of when to ignore a `when` statement for case
  statements, but also properly accept `when` in assignments.  (Issue #126)
* Tweaked a few snippets for better usability.

As always, if bugs are discovered, or features desired, please visit
