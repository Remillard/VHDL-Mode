Version 1.8.0

* Fixed issue where beautification would trigger on text that exists in
  strings.  Issue #106.
* Larger backend rewrite and refactor for beautification that ought to aid in
  fixing some of the weirder behaviors.  This is largely why the version
  incremented to 1.8.0 as it's a fair departure from the 1.7.x version.
* Comments should align better.  Comments will align with the line of code
  following the comment rather than the line of code preceding (most notable
  with case/when constructs.)  Additionally inline comments will align with
  each other and continuation full comment lines will align with the prior
  inline comment until the next non commented line.  Thus comments can look
  like:

  entity foobar is
      port (
          --
          -- Some Basic Stuff
          --
          clk   : std_logic; -- This clock will
                             -- run at 100 MHz
          reset : std_logic
      );
  end entity foobar;

* Altered a behavior to default to tabs rather than spaces for port
  copying so that the user's Sublime Text preferences will take effect
  upon saving. (Stefan Lippuner)
* Altered the order of the keybinds to make certain the default keybinds
  show up in the Command Palette hint (right side) instead of the Emacs ones.
  It's unlikely that Emacsen folk will be using the command palette too much
  and are likely to know the vhdl-mode keybinds by touch.
* Fixed generic map snippet having a trailing semicolon.
* Added file declaration to the block declarative items in the syntax file
  as file declarations were not being picked up in syntax there.  (They were
  in subprogram parameters though which was a weird oversight.)
* Improved signal and constant scoping and syntax identification by looking
  for the default value operator explicitly.
