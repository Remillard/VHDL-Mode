Version 1.8.0

This one has been a long time coming.  Thanks for the patience.

* Fixed issue where beautification would trigger on text that exists in
  strings.  Issue #106.  Also continued into the next point.
* Larger backend rewrite and refactor for beautification that ought to aid in
  fixing some of the weirder behaviors.  This is largely why the version
  incremented to 1.8.0 as it's a fair departure from the 1.7.x version.
* Comments should align better.  Comments will align with the line of code
  following the comment rather than the line of code preceding (most notable
  with case/when constructs.)  Additionally inline comments will align with
  each other and continuation full comment lines will align with the prior
  inline comment until the next non commented line.  Thus comments can look
  like:

  entity foobar is
      port (
          --
          -- Some Basic Stuff
          --
          clk   : std_logic; -- This clock will
                             -- run at 100 MHz
          reset : std_logic
      );
  end entity foobar;

* Altered a behavior to default to tabs rather than spaces for port
  copying so that the user's Sublime Text preferences will take effect
  upon saving. (Stefan Lippuner)
* Altered the order of the keybinds to make certain the default keybinds
  show up in the Command Palette hint (right side) instead of the Emacs ones.
  It's unlikely that Emacsen folk will be using the command palette too much
  and are likely to know the vhdl-mode keybinds by touch.
* Fixed generic map snippet having a trailing semicolon.
* Added file declaration to the block declarative items in the syntax file
  as file declarations were not being picked up in syntax there.  (They were
  in subprogram parameters though which was a weird oversight.)
* Improved signal and constant scoping and syntax identification by looking
  for the default value operator explicitly.
* A signal that contained the word 'configuration' was getting incorrectly
  indented due to needing a word boundary check in the regexp rule matching
  configurations.
* Added a much needed snippet for while loops.
* Added a requested snippet for configurations.  Fair warning, configurations
  can be wildly diverse and this is a single example for specifying a
  particular architecture for an instance in the targeted architecture of the
  targeted entity.  Edit to taste, I guess.
* Beautification frequently shifted the viewport to the right especially when
  working with split windows and now the viewport should not move during this
  operation.  Many thanks to FicheFoil, OdatNurd, and Mitranim on the Discord
  for working through this rather tricky problem.
* Fixed an issue with entity copying that would fail if the closing `);` of a
  `port ();` structure was immediately next to the last character.  It'd chop
  off the final character.  Issue was in the parenthetical extraction method.
